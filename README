pthread_hotplate
================

A Pthreads implementation of the hot-plate problem.

I created this implementation during the parallel processing class I took at BYU.

The plots directory is of interest only to me, unless anyone else is curious
about the results of my testing on the supercomputer (MaryLou 4).
